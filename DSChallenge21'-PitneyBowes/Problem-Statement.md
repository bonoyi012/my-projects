## Background

- Pitney Bowes is one of the leaders in the Mailing meters space

- Mailing meters allow businesses to be more productive by simplifying their mailing and shipping

- We offer leased hardware, as-well as SaaS solutions

- Our clients must be able to rely on our meters to function to meet their customers’ needs


## Problem Statement

 - Pitney Bowes uses predictive maintenance to reduce the risk of down-times of meters deployed at our clients’ offices
 
 - Since our meters are part of our clients’ business operations, we must be proactive about identifying potential problems early on to avoid any sort of disruption for our clients
 
 - Predictive maintenance allows us to have the required replacement parts where they are needed, and to proactively schedule an appointment with our customers if needed
 
 - The meters are Cloud-connected, which allows us to monitor the health of a device and detect potential problems early on
 
 - For this challenge, we generated a training sample for ~40k meters. You are asked to build a model that can predict which meters will fail within the next 7 days.
